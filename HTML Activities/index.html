    <h3>What I joined Code Nation?</h3>
    <P class="makeMePink">I joined Code Nation after previously completing the Develop Course and most recently the Innovate Course. I thoroughly enjoyed the two! Being a woman in Tech is what drove me to wanting to become a developer. My instructor for the Innovate course was a woman and she inspired me GREATLY!</P>

    <h3>My Targets & Progress</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            <h4>My confidence</h4>
            <p>I often struggle to speak infront of a group whether it be presenting a presentation or asking for help with something. I am progressing towards improving my confidence by asking more questions when I am struggling. I also requested to present my lightning talk first in order to face my fears</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>My general coding knowledge</h4>
            <p>I am working towards this by doing extra work and research outside of class</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Organisation skills</h4>
            <p>I am working towards this by trying to make sure I keep my VSCode folders as neatly as possible and making sure my code is also readable</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

<!-- Part of being a developer is having a portfolio 
to show potential employers or clients. It should 
include information about you. 
Using your HTML skills, continue from the “about 
me” page, start building your portfolio. Don’t 
worry about how it looks - just add content for 
now. 
Add images and links where needed -->
