    <h3>What I joined Code Nation?</h3>
    <P class="makeMePink">I joined Code Nation after previously completing the Develop Course and most recently the Innovate Course. I thoroughly enjoyed the two! Being a woman in Tech is what drove me to wanting to become a developer. My instructor for the Innovate course was a woman and she inspired me GREATLY!</P>

    <h3>My Targets & Progress</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            <h4>My confidence</h4>
            <p>I often struggle to speak infront of a group whether it be presenting a presentation or asking for help with something. I am progressing towards improving my confidence by asking more questions when I am struggling. I also requested to present my lightning talk first in order to face my fears</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>My general coding knowledge</h4>
            <p>I am working towards this by doing extra work and research outside of class</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Organisation skills</h4>
            <p>I am working towards this by trying to make sure I keep my VSCode folders as neatly as possible and making sure my code is also readable</p>
        </li>
